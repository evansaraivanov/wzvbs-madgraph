# wzvbs-madgraph

Included here is an example of:
1. script to generate events
2. run card
3. param card
4. analysis script

The cards have changes from default values. In run card, the changes are in cuts. The param card needs to be changed corresponding to which variable one would like to assess.

Full process directories can be found on the follow google drive link > https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1dfcebeW1XrWNl6G8tJm_6dAHqft2VYmC

The Cards folder is outdated as of now. The commit was made before I knew the madgraph configuration.
