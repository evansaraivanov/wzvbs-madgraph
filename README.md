# wzvbs-madgraph

Included here is an example of:
1. script to generate events
2. run card
3. param card
4. analysis script

The cards have changes from default values. In run card, the changes are in cuts. The param card needs to be changed corresponding to which variable one would like to assess.

The Cards folder is outdated as of now. The commit was made before I knew the madgraph configuration.
